# raw-tracks-tools

A suite of CLI scripts for processing video/audio recordings made in "raw-tracks" mode on [Daily](https://daily.co).

This recording type saves video and audio streams from a WebRTC session in individual files. The streams are recorded without any transcoding or processing, and they may start at different times. Samples received over the WebRTC connection may vary greatly: they may come in with delays, they may include varying resolutions within a single track (if a participant is sending multiple quality layers), and some packets may have been lost so there can be gaps. This kind of raw media data is incompatible with most video editing programs that expect a media track to have a stable sampling rate and a fixed resolution. Editing and compositing these raw-tracks files therefore requires normalizing the raw data into an editing-compatible format, and audio/video synchronization also requires aligning their start times. The normalize tool included here will do both operations.

You can find more information about creating these recordings in [Daily's documentation for raw-tracks](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/live-streaming-recording/recording-calls-with-the-daily-api#raw-tracks).

This repo includes tools for:

- Analyzing and converting individual participant tracks;
- Aligning audio and video tracks so they are in sync;
- Compositing all the participant tracks from a recording into a single MP4 file.

Compositing is done with Daily's open source [VCS](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-vcs) engine.
To control the output video's layout and overlay graphics, you can pass in composition params that work
the same way as with Daily's realtime cloud recording and streaming. See below for more details.

## Installation

Basic requirements:

- Node.js 18+
- ffmpeg in path

Run once in the repo root:

`npm install`

### Installation: compositing only

For compositing, you also need VCS:

- Clone the VCS SDK repo: https://github.com/daily-co/daily-vcs

In the VCS SDK repo, perform the following install operations once:

- Install the base SDK:
  `cd js; yarn install`

- Build the VCSRender tool:
  `cd server-render/vcsrender; meson setup build; ninja -C build`

Note that these tools have their individual dependencies:

- The base SDK needs just the `yarn` JavaScript package manager.
- VCSRender is a C++ program. At minimum it requires the Meson build tool.
  There are also some additional small dependencies on macOS.
  Before building VCSRender, please first check out `server-render/vcsrender/README.md` (in the VCS SDK repo).

## analyze-track

Prints a JSON describing a track from a raw-tracks recording, e.g. its data format and any gaps detected.

```
npm run analyze-track -- -i example-cam-video.webm
```

## normalize-track

Takes one or two webm files from raw-tracks recordings and processes them into a normalized format:

- Pauses in the video track are rendered as black
- Small drops in frame rate are padded with repeated frames (so that fps is even across the file)
- Any low-resolution samples within the video track are upscaled to the maximum resolution detected
- Video track's color space is converted to BT.709 standard if required
- Audio and video tracks are padded so they start at the same time

If you pass both a video and an audio file, a combined MPEG-4 file is written.
When a video track is normalized, the tool also writes a `*.gaps.json` sidecar next to the video output. If a combined MP4 is produced, the gap timestamps are relative to that combined file's playback timeline.
Pass `--gap-fill hold` to freeze the last good frame across detected gaps instead of rendering them as black. Leading gaps still render as black because there is no prior frame to hold.

Example usage:

```
npm run normalize-track -- -i example-cam-video.webm -i example-cam-audio.webm
```

You can also provide an output path using the -o option.

By default, audio tracks are re-encoded to AAC. Pass `--audio-codec wav` to emit a mono 48 kHz PCM WAV instead. (MP4 muxing is only performed when an AAC track is produced, since MP4 does not accept PCM audio.)

Example WAV-only normalization:

```
npm run normalize-track -- -i 1763063510722-audio.webm --audio-codec wav
```

## gen-manifest

Generates a raw-tracks manifest file by inspecting filenames in a directory containing raw-tracks recordings made on Daily.

```
npm run gen-manifest -- -i $PATH_TO_RAW_TRACKS_DIR
```

## composite-tracks

The tool combines audio and video tracks from a meeting and generates a single MP4 file,
optionally with layout options and graphics overlays of your choice.

The following arguments are required:

```
npm run composite-tracks -- \
        --vcs-sdk-path $PATH_TO_VCS_SDK \
        -i $INPUT_PATH_TO_RAW_TRACKS_MANIFEST_FILE
```

You must pass in a raw-tracks manifest. This is a JSON file that describes which tracks belong to the same recording timeline.

If you have raw-tracks files without a manifest, no problem! You can easily generate a manifest using the `gen-manifest` described in the previous section.

In the above CLI example, `$PATH_TO_VCS_SDK` should point to the VCS SDK repo root (see install instructions above).

By default, the tool tries to locate the VCSRender binary using the SDK path you pass in on the CLI, as follows:
`$PATH_TO_VCS_SDK/server-render/vcsrender/build/vcsrender`

The tool should be at that location by default, if you built it following the install instructions above.

You can also override the VCSRender program's location using the `--vcsrender-path` CLI argument, e.g. if you had the
program in `/usr/bin`:

```
        --vcsrender-path /usr/bin/vcsrender
```

### Specifying the output location

By default, the tool writes an mp4 in the same location as the raw-tracks manifest file.

You can override this using the `-o` argument:

```
    -o /var/foo/example_output.mp4
```

### Specifying the output size and rate

The default output size for rendering the composite is 1280x720.

You can override this using the `-w` and `-h` arguments:

```
    -w 1920 -h 1080
```

The default output frame rate is 30. You can override with `--fps`.

### Specifying layout and graphics options using composition params

The VCS render engine supports a wealth of composition options. They are the same as available for cloud recordings on Daily.

You can find them listed on Daily's documentation site for recording/streaming: [composition_params](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/rooms/recordings/start#composition-params)

The default layout mode is `grid`. You can find the other default param values behind the above link.

You can specify a custom `composition_params` object by providing it as a JSON file using the `--params` argument (or its shorthand `-p`):

```
    --params my_composition_params.json
```
